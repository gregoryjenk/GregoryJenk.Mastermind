                <li>
                    We will collect personal information by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent
                    of the individual concerned.
                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    We will collect and use personal information solely for fulfilling those purposes specified by us and for other ancillary

                </li>
                <li>
                    Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which it is to be used, and, to the extent necessary for those purposes,
                    should be accurate, complete, and up-to-date.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We will protect personal information by using reasonable security safeguards against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access,

            </ul>
            <p>
                We are committed to conducting our business in accordance with these principles in order to ensure that the confidentiality of
                personal information is protected and maintained.
